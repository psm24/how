How Can Sulfur and Copper be Removed from Iron Ore? 

Iron ore is a natural resource that is rich in iron and used for several industries. As valuable as iron ore is, it also has various impurities such as sulfur and copper, which are known to reduce the quality of iron produced. When processing iron ore, sulfur and copper are some of the impurities that can be removed, along with other elements, to obtain cleaner iron.

Sulfur is a detrimental element in iron ore, as it is known to make steel brittle while copper is known to break down the inherent ductility of iron, thus reducing its strength. Both sulfur and copper can have significant effects on the quality of iron and steel produced. In order to remove these impurities from iron ore, it is mixed with limestone in a blast furnace. The heat generated inside the furnace melts the iron ore and limestone together, forming a slag. Common impurities within the iron ore include sulfur and phosphorus, along with traces of other elements like manganese, magnesium, vanadium, and titanium.

In the blast furnace, the iron ore is varied with coke, limestone (a form of lime that contains mainly calcium carbonate), and carbon in the form of charcoal or coke. Coke is a solid carbonaceous material derived from destructive distillation of low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal. The limestone decomposes in the hot furnace, forming calcium oxide or lime, which reacts with the sulfur and other impurities, causing them to rise to the surface as a molten layer of slag. The slag can be skimmed off, leaving behind a purer form of iron.

To remove copper from iron ore, a reagent such as a flotation collector is added. The collector reacts with copper sulfide minerals, rendering them hydrophobic. Air is then injected into the flotation cells, and bubbles are generated. The bubbles and copper particles adhere to each other, forming a froth-like layer on the surface. This layer is then skimmed off, separating the copper from the iron ore.

Apart from the blast furnace process, iron ore can also be processed through direct reduction. Here, iron ore pellets are reduced at high temperatures using a reducing agent such as natural gas. The reduced iron is then melted and molded into desired shapes. Direct reduction can eliminate impurities from the iron ore by selectively removing only the impurities without affecting the iron content.

Overall, removal of sulfur and copper from iron ore has a significant impact on the quality, composition, and functionality of the resulting steel. The presence of these impurities can negatively affect processing techniques, cause equipment corrosion, and reduce the overall quality of the finished product. Therefore, various methods, such as blast furnace processes and direct reduction, are employed to remove these impurities by creating specific chemical reactions that allow their separation from the iron ore.
