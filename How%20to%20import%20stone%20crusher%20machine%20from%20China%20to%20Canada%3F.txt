Once the machine arrives in Canada, you need to clear it through customs. You will need to provide the necessary documentation, such as the bill of lading, commercial invoice, and customs declaration form, to the customs authorities. It is advisable to work with a customs broker to navigate through the customs clearance process smoothly.
