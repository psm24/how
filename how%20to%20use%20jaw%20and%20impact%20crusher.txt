How to Use Jaw and Impact Crusher: A Step-by-Step Guide

Crushing equipment plays an essential role in the aggregate and mining industries. It is used to break large rocks into smaller pieces for further processing. The two most common types of crushers are jaw and impact crushers. In this article, we will explore how to use jaw and impact crushers appropriately for efficient crushing.

Jaw Crusher

A jaw crusher is a compression type crusher, comprised of a fixed jaw and moving jaw positioned in a V-shaped alignment. The movable jaw compresses material against the fixed jaw, crushing it to the desired size. The material exits the jaw crusher through the bottom of the crusher otherwise known as the discharge opening.

Often, jaw crushers are used as primary crushers because they can take large and variable sized feed material. Jaw crushers are designed to crush efficiently and quickly, which is why they are often referred to as primary crushers. Jaw crushers are one of the most popular equipment types in the mining industry and they are known as a reliable and robust machine.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to effectively use a jaw crusher:

1. Remove any materials that do not meet the specifications of the desired output material. This step may involve removing larger blocks of rocks and boulders.

2. Ensure that the crusher is well-lubricated to minimize friction between the various components.

3. Inspect the wear parts, such as jaw plates, toggle plate, toggle seat, flywheel, and counterbalance weight, regularly, and replace them if necessary.

4. Start the crusher by pressing the start button.

5. Track the material onto the feeder, and ensure a consistent and regulated flow into the crushing chamber.

6. Position the material between the two jaws, and gradually squeeze it until it breaks.

7. Adjust the crusher discharge setting to achieve the desired product size.

8. Monitor the crushing process, tracking the feed material size, distribution, and production rate.

9. Stop the crusher by pressing the stop button.

Impact Crusher

An impact crusher, on the other hand, utilizes a rotating beaters or hammers in order to break material. The feed enters the machineâ€™s crushing chamber where it is struck by rapidly rotating hammers. The hammers repeatedly strike the material until it shatters into smaller pieces, passing through the openings in the screen.

To effectively use an impact crusher in the crushing process, it is important to understand its configuration and operation:

1. Start the equipment by pressing the start button.

2. Feed the material into the feeding hopper, making sure it is evenly distributed.

3. Adjust the feeder speed to achieve the desired flow rate.

4. The material is picked up by the rapidly rotating hammers and impact against the breaker plates. The energy from impact is absorbed, reducing the size of the material.

5. Monitor the crushing process and regulate the feeder speed to match the desired product size.

6. Stop the equipment by pressing the stop button.

In conclusion, jaw and impact crushers are key equipment types for mining and aggregate industries. When used correctly, they deliver efficient and consistent crushing performance. Understanding how to deploy and use these machines effectively will ensure successful operations and maximum productivity.
