How does a coal crusher work?

Coal is a versatile fuel that is used for various purposes. It is often used as a fuel in power plants, coal mines, and heavy industries. The coal crusher is widely used in coal mining and coal processing because of its advantages.

In the coal crushing plant, coal crushing can resize the coal stone so that it can be easily handled and processed. For the Mosh hardness of coal is usually under 5, the miners can use jaw crusher, impact crusher, hammer crusher, etc.

After the coal has been crushed, we need vibrating screen to grade the coal by size and then transport the coal via belt conveyor. In this process, dewatering screen is optional to remove water from the product.

Coal crushers play a vital role in the coal crushing process. They have an important influence on coal processing and coal production. They are widely used in coal mines and other energy industries.

Coal crushers can be divided into three categories according to their working principle: impact crushers, hammer crushers, and roller crushers.

1. Impact crushers are usually used as primary crushers, and they are designed to crush the materials into small pieces. There are two main types of impact crushers: horizontal shaft impactor (HSI) and vertical shaft impactor (VSI). They are used as primary, secondary, or tertiary crushers depending on the size and application of the material.

2. Hammer crushers consist of a series of hammers that are mounted on a central shaft. The materials are fed into the crusher chamber and crushed by the repeated impacts of the rotating hammers. Hammer crushers are used for medium-hard to soft materials, such as limestone, gypsum, coal, etc.

3. Roller crushers are compression crushers that use rollers to crush the material. The material is fed into the crusher chamber, and the two rolls rotate in opposite directions. The rollers crush the coal into small particles, and the particles are discharged from the bottom of the crusher.

The coal crusher is designed to reduce large coal pieces into smaller ones. Crushing reduces the overall top size of the coal so that it can be more easily handled and processed within the plant. For coal crushing, primarily adopting the mechanical force to conquer and destroy the internal binding force of coal, making the process of crushing coal more efficient and energy-saving.

In conclusion, the coal crusher machine has simplified the coal crushing process and contributed to the efficiency of coal production. It has provided a new platform for the utilization of coal resources, paving the way for the promotion of coal utilization and green development. With continuous improvements in technology and equipment, the coal crusher will continue to evolve and meet the needs of the coal industry.
