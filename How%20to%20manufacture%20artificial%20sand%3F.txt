How to Manufacture Artificial Sand?

With the rapid development of infrastructure projects, the demand for construction materials is increasing day by day. Natural sand, which is commonly used as a construction material, is becoming scarce due to excessive mining and environmental concerns. To meet the demand for sand, artificial sand is being manufactured as an alternative. In this article, we will discuss the process of manufacturing artificial sand in detail.

The first step in manufacturing artificial sand is primary crushing. Jaw crusher, impact crusher, or cone crusher are used for primary crushing. It is important to select the right crusher based on the feed size and the desired product size. Once the primary crushing is done, secondary crushing is required to further reduce the product size. A cone crusher or an impact crusher can be used for this purpose.

After the crushing process, the raw materials need to be screened to separate the particles of the desired size. The vibrating screen is commonly used for this purpose. The screen deck separates the material into different sizes based on the mesh size of the screen. The oversize material from the screen is sent back to the crusher for further crushing, while the undersize material is sent to the sand making machine.

The sand making machine, also known as the vertical shaft impact crusher, is responsible for making artificial sand. It is highly efficient in breaking down hard and brittle materials, such as rocks and stones. The sand making machine uses centrifugal force to accelerate the materials and throw them against a hard surface, causing them to break into small pieces. The broken pieces are then further crushed and shaped to obtain the desired shape and size of the artificial sand.

The next step in the process is sand washing. The sand that comes out from the sand making machine may contain impurities and dirt. The sand washing machine is used to remove these impurities and clean the sand. It agitates the sand with water and pushes it through a series of screens to remove the impurities. Once the sand is clean, it is ready for use.

In some cases, to enhance the properties of artificial sand, additional processes such as grading and drying are performed. Grading involves the separation of particles based on their size. This is done using various techniques, such as sieving or air classification. Drying is done to remove any moisture content present in the sand. Different drying methods, such as natural drying or mechanical drying, can be employed based on the desired moisture level.

In conclusion, the manufacturing of artificial sand involves several steps. Primary and secondary crushing, screening, sand making, sand washing, grading, and drying are the key processes involved. By following these steps, high-quality artificial sand can be produced to meet the demands of the construction industry. Manufactured sand not only helps in conserving the natural resources but also reduces environmental pollution caused by excessive mining.
