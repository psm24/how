The stone that is too large to pass through the top deck of the scalping screen is processed in the secondary crushing plant. Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary crushing. The output from the secondary crusher and the throughs from the secondary screen are transported by conveyor to the tertiary circuit, which includes a sizing screen and a tertiary crusher.

Gyratory and jaw crushers are the bulk of primary crushers applied in mining operations modern time. Roller impact crushers, VSI crusher are often used in secondary crushing operations. Cone crushers remain the most popular for fine crushing applications, although some mines use vertical impact crushers for tertiary and quaternary crushing.
