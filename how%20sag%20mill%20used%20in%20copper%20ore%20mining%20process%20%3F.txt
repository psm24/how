Title: The Role of SAG Mills in Copper Ore Mining Process

Introduction

The expansion of mining activities in recent years has led to an increased demand for copper. With its unique properties and numerous applications in various industries, copper is one of the most sought-after metals worldwide. To extract copper from its ores, the mining process typically involves grinding and concentrating the ore into a fine powder for further processing. This is where SAG (Semi-Autogenous) mills come into play. This article aims to delve into the use of SAG mills in the copper ore mining process and their benefits.

Copper mining overview

The copper-rich rocks extracted from underground or open-pit mines are crushed into smaller pieces before being transported to the surface. Once on the surface, the ore is ground into a finer particle size to facilitate the subsequent separation of valuable copper-bearing minerals from the rocky gangue material.

The significance of SAG mills

SAG mills, also known as primary mills, are used in the initial stages of ore grinding. They can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening, a cone crusher and a ball mill, making them well-suited for semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) operations. Under certain circumstances, they can also perform ball milling duties.

SAG mill structure and function

SAG mills consist of a rotating cylinder with a large diameter that is mostly filled with steel balls. As the ore is fed into the mill, the grinding media crushes and grinds the ore particles. The product from the SAG mill is further reduced in size using pebble crushers and ball mills. Hence, typical gold or copper ore requires between 2.0 and 7.5 kWh per ton of energy to reduce the particle size.

Considering a typical mining operation processes 10,000 to 100,000 tons per day, the energy expenditure in grinding is 50 percent of the cost of production of the metal. A research team from the University of Utah is currently working to apply their ball mill grinding technology in the mining industry to reduce energy consumption.

Comparing SAG mills with AG mills

SAG mills differ from AG mills primarily due to the addition of steel balls. They also have the advantage of a lower capital cost, as the capital cost of SAG mills is lower than that for AG mills. SAG mill advantages include:

1. Finer grind due to the cascading and grinding of the balls.

2. Smaller footprint compared to other mills of the same power rating.

3. Lower operating cost in terms of power consumption and maintenance.

4. Ability to function in an open circuit with ball mill.

5. Upgrading the classifier and baghouse involves capital expenditure with a high benefit to cost ratio.

Conclusion

SAG mills are an integral piece in various stages of the mining process. These mills are primarily used for grinding and crushing mined ore, further reducing its size for processing and extraction of valuable metals. The SAG mill design requires a higher degree of attention due to the equipment's critical role in the grinding process.

The SAG mill has gained popularity since such mills have the capability to handle coarser feed materials. As the emphasis shifts from the production of base metals to the extraction of valuable metals from low-grade ores, the importance of SAG mills is expected to grow in the mining industry.
