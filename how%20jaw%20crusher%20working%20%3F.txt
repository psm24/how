how jaw crusher working ?
A jaw crusher is a device designed to reduce large solid chunks of raw material into smaller chunks. Working principle of a jaw crusher is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.

The moving jaw moves back and forward against the fixed jaw, and material fed from the top of the machine is compressed between the two, breaking it into smaller pieces. As the moving jaw moves away from the fixed jaw, the crushed material is discharged from the crusher at the bottom, with the size determined by the gap between the two jaws.

The jaws themselves are typically made of cast steel and are fitted with replaceable liners, made of manganese steel, which can be replaced or reversed when worn out. This ensures long service life and efficient operation of the crusher.

To enable the crushing process to run smoothly and efficiently, the jaw crusher is equipped with an overload protection device. A safety toggle plate, located at the bottom of the crusher, supports the movable jaw and prevents it from being too tight or loose, thereby preventing damage to the crusher or causing injury to personnel.

In addition to the overload protection device, the jaw crusher also features a mechanical or hydraulic adjustment mechanism for controlling the size of the discharge opening. This enables the crusher to produce a predetermined range of sizes, ensuring that the final product meets the desired specifications.

To power the crusher, an electric motor or diesel engine drives a belt and pulley, which in turn drives the eccentric shaft. The movement of the eccentric shaft causes the movable jaw to move back and forth along a predetermined path, crushing the material in the process.

The size of the crushed material can be adjusted by manually or automatically adjusting the gap between the two jaws. In some jaw crushers, an automatic hydraulic system is provided to facilitate the adjustment process, ensuring that the crusher operates efficiently and delivers the desired product size.

Overall, a jaw crusher is a highly efficient and user-friendly machinery that delivers excellent crushing performance. It is widely used in various industries, including mining, construction, metallurgy, highways, railways, and chemical industries. With its simplicity in design, robust construction, and ability to handle different types of materials, a jaw crusher is a valuable asset in any crushing operation.
