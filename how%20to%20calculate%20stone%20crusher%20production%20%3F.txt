how to calculate stone crusher production ?
Stone crusher is a unique machinery that is used to crush stones into small pieces with the guidance of highly skilled professionals. It is widely used in quarries, mines, construction and other industries. Stone crushers have become an indispensable equipment in modern production lines due to their efficiency and low operating costs.

Stone crushers can be classified into primary crushing, secondary crushing, and tertiary crushing machineries according to their crushing application. Primary crushers are generally designed to handle larger stones while secondary crushers process smaller stones into a more manageable size. Tertiary crushers are used to produce finely crushed material when further reduction is needed past primary and secondary crushing.

Stone crushers are designed to handle a wide range of materials, including rocks, slag, coal, stone, and minerals. They are also used for crushing sandstone, limestone, granite, basalt, gravel, and other stones. Very often, they are integrated into a complete crushing production line, and the performance of the entire line depends on the quality of the stone crusher.

The production process of the stone crusher is generally carried out in four stages: coarse crushing, medium crushing, fine crushing, and screening. The first stage: coarse crushing. The stone blasted from the mountain is fed uniformly by the vibrating feeder through the silo and transported to the jaw crusher for coarse crushing. The second stage: medium fine crushing. The coarsely crushed materials are screened by vibrating screen and then conveyed by belt conveyor to impact crusher or cone crusher for medium fine crushing. The third stage: screening. The medium fine crushed stones are sent to the vibrating screen to be screened into medium-sized and small-sized stones, and the large-sized stones are returned to the impact crusher or cone crusher for re-crushing. The fourth stage: storage. The finished product is transported by the conveyor belt to the finished product area for stacking for further sales or direct use.

To calculate the production capacity of stone crusher, it is necessary to define the maximum feed size, discharge opening size and processing capacity of the equipment. The processing capacity refers to the stone crusher and the coexisting equipment combined with the stone crusher. The maximum feed size refers to the specified feed inlet size of the stone crusher. The discharge opening size refers to the finished product size of the stone crusher and the required size of the material after crushing.

To calculate the production capacity of stone crusher per hour, it is necessary to understand what factors affect the production capacity.

First, stone size: the bigger the stone size, the higher the productivity.

Second, the type of stone: ordinary stone, such as granite, basalt, limestone, etc., has a larger volume. The smaller the type of stone, such as sandstone, the higher the productivity.

Third, the humidity of the material: when the moisture content of the material is more than 5%, the production capacity of the stone crusher will be reduced.

Fourth, the hardness of the material: the harder the material, the more difficult it is to break, and the more serious the abrasion of equipment.

In conclusion, stone crusher production line efficiency is affected by many factors, including stone crusher technical parameters, ore properties, operating conditions, etc. The production capacity of a stone crusher is related to the size of the feed opening, the particle size after crushing, and the discharge opening size. Whether it is a fixed crusher or portable rock crusher, it has its own advantages and application range. The performance of Fote stone crusher can reach international level, and they enjoy a good reputation both at home and abroad.
