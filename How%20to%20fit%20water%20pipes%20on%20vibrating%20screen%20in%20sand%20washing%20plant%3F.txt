How to fit water pipes on vibrating screen in sand washing plant?

In a sand washing plant, one of the important components is the vibrating screen. It is responsible for removing oversize impurities and ensuring that the sand meets the required specifications. However, to effectively carry out its function, the vibrating screen requires adequate water supply. Here are some steps on how to fit water pipes on a vibrating screen in a sand washing plant.

1. Determine the Water Requirement:

Before fitting water pipes on a vibrating screen, it is essential to determine the water requirement of the screen. This can be done by considering factors such as the screen size, feed rate, moisture content of the incoming sand, and the desired cleanliness of the output sand. The water requirement will dictate the water pressure and flow rate needed for optimal screen performance.

2. Locate the Water Inlet:

Inspect the vibrating screen and identify the water inlet. This is the point where the water will be introduced into the system. It is typically found on the side or top of the screen, depending on the screen design. The inlet is usually connected to a water supply line, which can be sourced from a municipal supply or a water storage tank.

3. Install Water Pipes:

Once the water inlet is located, the next step is to install the water pipes. Use appropriate piping material, such as PVC or stainless steel, to ensure durability and longevity. The diameter of the pipes should be selected based on the required water flow rate. It is recommended to consult with a plumbing professional to determine the optimal pipe size.

4. Consider Water Diversion:

In some cases, it may be necessary to divert water from multiple sources to the vibrating screen. This can be achieved by using valves and connectors to split the water supply. Diverting water from different sources allows for more flexibility in adjusting the water flow and pressure to suit the specific requirements of the vibrating screen.

5. Add Water Pressure Regulator:

To maintain consistent water pressure, it is advisable to install a pressure regulator in the water supply line. The pressure regulator ensures that the water pressure remains constant, regardless of any fluctuations in the main water supply. This is important for the smooth operation of the vibrating screen and prevents excess water flow that could lead to screen damage or a reduction in performance.

6. Test and Adjust:

After fitting the water pipes, it is crucial to test the water supply system before using the vibrating screen. Check for any leaks or blockages in the pipes and ensure that water is reaching all parts of the screen evenly. Adjust the water flow and pressure as necessary to achieve the desired screen performance.

In conclusion, fitting water pipes on a vibrating screen in a sand washing plant is essential to ensure effective sand screening and washing. By following these steps, you can ensure that the vibrating screen receives an adequate water supply, leading to improved sand cleanliness and reduced equipment downtime. Remember to consult with professionals if needed and to perform regular maintenance to keep the water supply system in optimal condition.
