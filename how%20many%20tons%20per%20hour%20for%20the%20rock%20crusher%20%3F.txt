how many tons per hour for the rock crusher ?
Rock crushing machines are highly essential in the mineral processing and extractive industries. These machines are solely responsible for crushing large rocks into gravel, smaller rocks, or even dust powder. These machines are designed with a strong and heavy material that can withstand intense pressure from the crushing process. Each rock breaker machine has a capacity of crushing specific rock material, processed in a continuous and uninterrupted manner.

In the mining industry, crushers are used to crush different types of minerals and ores. For instance, mining machines like jaw crushers and cone crushers are used to crush large rocks into smaller rocks or gravel. These machines have a breaking capacity of up to 500 tons per hour. Being able to break down large rocks is an essential aspect of any successful mining operation.

Crushers are designed to handle different sizes of rock material. Commonly, primary crushers are jaw crushers while secondary crushers are cone crushers. Jaw crushers have the capability of crushing larger and harder rocks into smaller pieces. Cone crushers are used to further break down rock material into finer sized particles.

The capacities of these rock crushers increase with the size of the opening. Crushing capacity is measured in tons per hour. But, understanding how to calculate the needed tonnage for a project is a complicated process. The accuracy of capacity calculations depends on many factors, including the material characteristics, production rate, belt speed, and the specific design parameters of the equipment dimensions.

For instance, consider a crusher with a maximum capacity of 200 tons per hour. The material from the mine is dumped into the crusher feed hopper, and then transported to a conveyor belt that separates the ore from the waste rock. As the rocks enter the crusher, they get crushed and reduced into smaller sizes, ready for further processing.

It is important to understand the factors that determine the capacity of a rock crusher. The hardness, toughness, and size of the rock material will all affect the capacity requirements of a crusher. Efficiency will also depend on the type of rock and its gradation.

Another important consideration is the feed size distribution from the primary crusher. The maximum feed size to the secondary crusher is typically limited by the necessary size reduction ratio. For example, if the feed size of the primary crusher is too large, it can lead to a reduction in the capacity of the secondary crusher.

Different crushers have different methods of adjusting their settings and determining the output size. For instance, cone crushers use a rotating bowl and an eccentric motion to crush the rock between the bowl and the mantle. On the other hand, jaw crushers use compression forces to break the particles.

In conclusion, rock crushers have specific regulations that limit their output capacity depending on the size and the desired consistency of the crushed material. A jaw crusher is used at the beginning of the process, i.e. in the primary crushing phase, to crush the largest boulders. In secondary crushing, smaller jaw crushers are used that can produce an output of fewer than 2 inches. Depending on the desired product, the stones can travel through three or four different types of stone crushers. As each crushing stage passes, the rocks experience different stages of crushing resulting in smaller sizes.
